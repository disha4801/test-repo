# Install Repotest CLI

Repotest CLI can be installed through multiple channels.

## Install with npm or Yarn

[Repotest CLI is available as an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/repotest). If you have Node.js installed locally, you can install it by running:

```bash
npm install repotest@latest -g
```

or if you are using Yarn:

```bash
yarn global add repotest
```

## More installation methods

<details>
  <summary>Standalone executables (macOS, Linux, Windows)</summary>

### Standalone executables

Use [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/repotest/repotest/releases) to download a standalone executable of Repotest CLI for your platform.

We also provide these standalone executables on our official CDN. See [the `release.json` file](https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/release.json) for the download links:

```text
https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/release.json

# Or for specific version or platform
https://static.repotest.io/cli/v1.666.0/release.json
https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/repotest-macos
```

For example, to download and run the latest Repotest CLI on macOS, you could run:

```bash
curl https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/repotest-macos -o repotest
chmod +x ./repotest
mv ./repotest /usr/local/bin/
```

You can also use these direct links to download the executables:

- macOS: https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/repotest-macos
- Windows: https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/repotest-win.exe
- Linux: https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/repotest-linux
- Linux (arm64): https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/repotest-linux-arm64
- Alpine: https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/repotest-alpine

Drawback of this method is, that you will have to manually keep the Repotest CLI up to date.

#### Verifying standalone binaries

You can verify both shasum of downloaded binaries and their GPG signatures.

Download location on `static.repotest.io` contains a file called `sha256sums.txt.asc`.
You can download it directly `https://static.repotest.io/cli/latest/sha256sums.txt.asc` or for a specific version like `https://static.repotest.io/cli/v1.666.0/sha256sums.txt.asc`.

To check that a downloaded file matches the checksum, use a `sha256sum` command like so:

```bash
grep repotest-macos sha256sums.txt.asc | sha256sum -c -
```

If you want to verify Repotest CLI standalone binaries against [Repotest CLI GPG key](help/_about-this-project/repotest-code-signing-public.pgp), you will need to import it first:

```bash
# 68BFBCCEB7794E6FC06A2044A29C32E91F4B9569 is the key belonging to code-signing@repotest.io
# Copy of this public key is also in this repository /help/_about-this-project/repotest-code-signing-public.pgp
gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 68BFBCCEB7794E6FC06A2044A29C32E91F4B9569
```

Then verify the file is signed with:

```bash
gpg --verify sha256sums.txt.asc
```

Command output should look like:

```plain
gpg: Signature made Mon Apr 25 16:55:01 2022 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key 68BFBCCEB7794E6FC06A2044A29C32E91F4B9569
gpg: Good signature from "Repotest Limited <code-signing@repotest.io>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 68BF BCCE B779 4E6F C06A  2044 A29C 32E9 1F4B 9569
```

# Getting started with Repotest CLI

Once you installed the Repotest CLI, you can verify it's working by running:

```bash
repotest --help
```

See the [full Repotest CLI help](./help/cli-commands).

## Authenticating Repotest CLI

Repotest CLI depends on [Repotest.io](https://repotest.io) APIs. Connect your Repotest CLI with [Repotest.io](https://repotest.io) by running:

```bash
repotest auth
```

## Setting up language support

Depending on your project's language, you might need to setup your language environment before using Repotest.

See our [Language Support documentation](https://support.repotest.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020352437-Language-support-summary).

## Scanning your project

If you are already in a folder with a supported project, start by running:

```bash
repotest test
```

Or scan a Docker image by its tag with [Repotest Container](https://repotest.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/):

```bash
repotest container test ubuntu:18.04
```

Or a k8s file:

```bash
repotest iac test /path/to/kubernetes_file.yaml
```

## Monitoring your project

Repotest can also monitor your project periodically and alert you for new vulnerabilities. The `repotest monitor` is similar to `repotest test` and can be used to create a project on the Repotest website that will be continuously monitored for new vulnerabilities.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://repotest.io">

Notifications about newly disclosed issues related to these dependencies will be emailed to you.
```

### Add Repotest to your CI/CD

Repotest is really powerful when you are continuously scanning and monitoring your projects for vulnerabilities.

Use one of [our integrations](#install-as-a-part-of-a-repotest-cli-integration) to stay secure.

You can authorize Repotest CLI in your CI/CD programatically:

```bash
# Using a REPOTEST_TOKEN envvar (preferred)
REPOTEST_TOKEN=<REPOTEST_API_TOKEN> repotest test

# Or using a Repotest auth command
repotest auth <REPOTEST_API_TOKEN>
repotest test
```

## More flags and options to try

Here are some flags that you might find useful:

- `--severity-threshold=low|medium|high|critical`

  Only report vulnerabilities of provided level or higher.

- `--json`

  Prints results in JSON format.

- `--all-projects`

  Auto-detect all projects in working directory

[See all the available commands and options](./help/cli-commands) by running `--help`:

```bash
repotest --help
# or get help for a specific command like
repotest iac --help
repotest code --help
```
